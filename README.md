## Preview locally

Run a static server from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Regenerate assets

If the original source files are still in `/Users/home/Downloads/Descript videos`:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_assets.py
python3 scripts/render_brand_assets.py
python3 scripts/render_video_package.py
```

## Notes

- The provided `M5` and `M6` exports were zero-byte placeholders, so the delivered curriculum preserves the usable order from the supplied source set: `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, `M4`, `M7`, `M8`, `M9`.
- The current login is a standard front-end email/password gate for the static portal. If you want real user accounts, that needs a backend or managed auth provider.
